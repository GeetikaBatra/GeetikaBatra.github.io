<p>Hi, I'm Geetika. I work as a Senior Software Developer with Oerlikon, Germany where I have an  intermediate role between CI CD developer and Site Reliable Engineer. My responsibilities at Oerlikon includes upgrading and maintaining inhouse Gitlab and developing & maintaining Kubernetes based cluster using ansible playbooks. The role also involves writing automation scripts to achieve all the work items. I was a part of Red Hat before Oerlikon. My work primarily revolved around backend development utilizing docker, kubernetes and build microservices. Though I was a part of Analytics team where my work was closely related to Data Engineering, I had to collaborate with other Opensource teams and write code to integrate our product.<br/><br/> Prior to joining Red Hat, I contributed to <a href="https://www.openstack.org" target="_blank">OpenStack</a>.I have strong interest in Web Services and Distributed Systems and I have more than three years of experience with Python and Automation, I also have been writing a lot of Go code recently. I <3 Open Source, and try to <a href="http://github.com/GeetikaBatra" target="_blank">contribute</a> as much as I can.
